# symbolic-ai
A sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model to map mathematical expressions to their Taylor series expansion.

## Introduction
The jupyter notebooks in this package depend on the following Python packages:

| __modules__   | __description__     |
| :---          | :---        |
| re            | regular expressions |
| sympy         | an excellent symbolic algebra module |
| numpy         | array manipulation and numerical analysis      |
| random        | random numbers |
